The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber
by Ernest Hemingway
It was now lunch time and they were all sitting under the double green 
fly of the dining tent pretending that nothing had happened.
“Will you have lime juice or lemon squash?” Macomber asked.
“I‟ll have a gimlet,” Robert Wilson told him.
“I‟ll have a gimlet too. I need something,” Macomber‟s wife said.
“I suppose it‟s the thing to do,” Macomber agreed. “Tell him to make 
three gimlets.”
The mess boy had started them already, lifting the bottl
es out of the 
canvas cooling bags that sweated wet in the wind that blew through the 
trees that shaded the tents.
“What had I ought to give them?” Macomber asked.
“A quid would be plenty,” Wilson told him. “You don‟t want to spoil 
them.”
“Will the headm
an distribute it?”
“Absolutely.”
Francis Macomber had, half an hour before, been carried to his tent 
from the edge of the camp in triumph on the arms and shoulders of the 
cook, the personal boys, the skinner and the porters. The gun
-
bearers 
had taken no 
part in the demonstration. When the native boys put
him 
down at the door of his tent, he had shaken all their hands, received their 
congratulations, and then gone into the tent and sat on the bed until his 
wife came in. She did not speak to him when she c
ame in and he left the 
tent at once to wash his face and hands in the portable wash basin 
outside and go over to the dining tent to sit in a comfortable canvas 
chair in the breeze and the shade.
“You‟ve got your lion,” Robert Wilson said to him, “and a da
mned fine 
one too.” 
Mrs. Macomber looked at Wilson quickly. She was an extremely 
handsome and well kept woman of the beauty and social position which 
had, five years before, commanded five thousand dollars as the price of 
endorsing, with photographs, a b
eauty product which she had never 
used. She had been married to Francis Macomber for eleven years.
“He is a good lion, isn‟t he?” Macomber said. His wife looked at him 
now. She looked at both these men as though she had never seen them 
before.
One, Wilso
n, the white hunter, she knew she had never truly seen 
before. He was about middle height with sandy hair, a stubby mustache, 
a very red face and extremely cold blue eyes with faint white wrinkles at 
the corners that grooved merrily when he smiled. He smil
ed at her now 
and she looked away from his face at the way his shoulders sloped in the 
loose tunic he wore with the four big cartridges held in loops where the 
left breast pocket should have been, at his big brown hands, his old 
slacks, his very dirty boot
s and back to his red face again. She noticed 
where the baked red of his face stopped in a white line that marked the 
circle left by his Stetson hat that hung now from one of the pegs of the 
tent pole.
“Well, here‟s to the lion,” Robert Wilson said. He sm
iled at her again 
and, not smiling, she looked curiously at her husband.
Francis Macomber was very tall, very well built if you did not mind that 
length of bone, dark, his hair cropped like an oarsman, rather thin
-
lipped, and was considered handsome. He w
as dressed in the same sort 
of safari clothes that Wilson wore except that his were new, he was 
thirty
-
five years old, kept himself very fit, was good at court games, had 
a number of big
-
game fishing records, and had just shown himself, very 
publicly, to b
e a coward.
“Here‟s to the lion,” he said. “I can‟t ever thank you for what you did.”
Margaret, his wife, looked away from him and back to Wilson.
“Let‟s not talk about the lion,” she said.
2
Wilson looked over at her without smiling and now she smiled a
t him.
“It‟s been a very strange day,” she said. “Hadn‟t you ought to put your 
hat on even under the canvas at noon? You told me that, you know.”
“Might put it on,” said Wilson.
“You know you have a very red face, Mr. Wilson,” she told him and 
smiled ag
ain.
“Drink,” said Wilson.
“I don‟t think so,” she said. “Francis drinks a great deal, but his face is 
never red.”
“It‟s red today,” Macomber tried a joke.
“No,” said Margaret. “It‟s mine that‟s red today. But Mr. Wilson‟s is 
always red.
“Must be raci
al,” said Wilson. “I say, you wouldn‟t like to drop my 
beauty as a topic, would you?”
“I‟ve just started on it.”
“Let‟s chuck it,” said Wilson.
“Conversation is going to be so difficult,” Margaret said.
“Don‟t be silly, Margot,” her husband said.
“No 
difficulty,” Wilson said. “Got a damn fine lion.”
Margot looked at them both and they both saw that she was going to cry. 
Wilson had seen it coming for a long time and he dreaded it. Macomber 
was past dreading it.
“I wish it hadn‟t happened. Oh, I wish i
t hadn‟t happened,” she said and 
started for her tent. She made no noise of crying but they could see that 
her shoulders were shaking under the rose
-
colored, sun
-
proofed shirt she 
wore.
“Women upset,” said Wilson to the tall man. “Amounts to nothing. 
Stra
in on the nerves and one thing‟n another.”
“No,” said Macomber. “I suppose that I rate that for the rest of my life 
now.”
“Nonsense. Let‟s have a spot of the giant killer,” said Wilson. “Forget 
the whole thing. Nothing to it anyway.”
“We might try,” sai
d Macomber. “I won‟t forget what you did for me 
though.” 
“Nothing,” said Wilson. All nonsense.”
So they sat there in the shade where the camp was pitched under some 
wide
-
topped acacia trees with a boulder
-
strewn cliff behind them, and a 
stretch of grass
that ran to the bank of a boulder
-
filled stream in front 
with forest beyond it, and drank their just
-
cool lime drinks and avoided 
one another‟s eyes while the boys all knew about it now and when he 
saw Macomber‟s personal boy looking curiously at his mast
er while he 
was putting dishes on the table he snapped at him in Swahili. The boy 
turned away with his face blank.
“What were you telling him?” Macomber asked.
“Nothing. Told him to look alive or I‟d see he got about fifteen of the 
best.”
“What‟s that? 
Lashes?”
“It‟s quite illegal,” Wilson said. “You‟re supposed to fine them.”
“Do you still have them whipped?”
“Oh, yes. They could raise a row if they chose to complain. But they 
don‟t. They prefer it to the fines.”
3
“How strange!” said Macomber.
“Not 
strange, really,” Wilson said. “Which would you rather do? Take a 
good birching or lose your pay?”
Then he felt embarrassed at asking it and before Macomber could 
answer he went on, “We all take a beating every day, you know, one 
way or another.”
This wa
s no better. “Good God,” he thought. “I am a diplomat, aren‟t 
I?”
“Yes, we take a beating,” said Macomber, still not looking at him. “I‟m 
awfully sorry about that lion business. It doesn‟t have to go any further, 
does it? I mean no one will hear about it,
will they?”
“You mean will I tell it at the Mathaiga Club?” Wilson looked at him 
now coldly. He had not expected this. So he‟s a bloody four
-
letter man 
as well as a bloody coward, he thought. I rather liked him too until 
today. But how is one to know abu
t an American?
“No,” said Wilson. “I‟m a professional hunter. We never talk about our 
clients. You can be quite easy on that. It‟s supposed to be bad form to 
ask us not to talk though.”
He had decided now that to break would be much easier. He would eat,
then, by himself and could read a book with his meals. They would eat 
by themselves. He would see them through the safari on a very formal 
basis
—
what was it the French called it? Distinguished consideration
—
and it would be a damn sight easier than having 
to go through this 
emotional trash. He‟d insult him and make a good clean break. Then he 
could read a book with his meals and he‟d still be drinking their 
whisky.
That was the phrase for it when a safari went bad. You ran into 
another while hunter and you
asked, “How is everything going?” and he 
answered, “Oh, I‟m still drinking their whisky,” and you knew 
everything had gone to pot.
“I‟m sorry,” Macomber said and looked at him with his American face 
that would stay adolescent until it became middle
-
aged,
and Wilson 
noted his crew
-
cropped hair, fine eyes only faintly shifty, good nose, 
thin lips and handsome jaw. “I‟m sorry I didn‟t
realize
that. There are 
lots of things I don‟t know.”
So what could he do, Wilson thought. He was all ready to break it off 
quickly and neatly and here the beggar was apologizing after he had just 
insulted him. He made one more attempt. “Don‟t worry about me 
talking,” he said. “I have a living to make. You know in Africa no 
woman ever misses her lion and no white man ever bolts
.
“I bolted like a rabbit,” Macomber said.
Now what in hell were you going to do about a man who talked like 
that, Wilson wondered.
Wilson looked at Macomber with his flat, blue, machinegunner‟s eyes 
and the other smiled back at him. He had a pleasant s
mile if you did not 
notice how his eyes showed when he was hurt.
“Maybe I can fix it up on buffalo,” he said. “We‟re after them next, 
aren‟t we?
“In the morning if you like,” Wilson told him. Perhaps he had been 
wrong. This was certainly the way to take 
it. You most certainly could 
not tell a damned thing about an American. He was all for Macomber 
again. If you could forget the morning. But, of course, you couldn‟t. The 
morning had been about as bad as they come.
“Here comes the Memsahib,” he said. She w
as walking over from her 
tent looking refreshed and cheerful and quite lovely. She had a very 
perfect oval face, so perfect that you expected her to be stupid. But she 
wasn‟t stupid, Wilson thought, no, not stupid.
“How is the beautiful red
-
faced Mr. Wils
on?
Are you feeling better, 
Francis, my pearl?”
“Oh, much,” said Macomber.
“I‟ve dropped the whole thing,” she said, sitting down at the table. 
“What importance is there to whether Francis is any good at killing 
lions? That‟s not his trade. That‟s Mr. W
ilson‟s trade. Mr. Wilson is 
4
really very impressive killing anything. You do kill anything, don‟t 
you?”
“Oh, anything,” said Wilson. “Simply anything.” They are, he thought, 
the hardest in the world; the hardest, the cruelest, the most predatory and 
the m
ost attractive and their men have softened or gone to pieces 
nervously as they have hardened. Or is it that they pick men they can 
handle? They can‟t know that much at the age they marry, he thought. 
He was grateful that he had gone through his education o
n American 
women before
now
because this was a very attractive one.
“We‟re going after buff in the morning,” he told her.
“
I‟m
coming,” she said.
“No, you‟re not.”
“Oh, yes, I am. Mayn‟t I, Francis?”
“Why not stay in camp”
“Not for anything,” she sai
d. “I wouldn‟t miss something like today for 
anything.
When she left, Wilson was thinking, when she went off to cry, she 
seemed a hell of a fine woman. She seemed to unde
rstand, to realize, to 
be hurt f
o
r
him and for herself and to know how things really 
stood. She 
is away for twenty minutes and now she is back, simply enameled in 
that American female cruelty. They are the damnedest women. Really 
the damnedest.
“We‟ll put on another show for you tomorrow,” Francis Macomber said.
“You‟re not coming,” Wils
on said.
“You‟re very mistaken,” she told him. “And I want so to see you 
perform again. You were lovely this morning. That is if blowing things‟ 
heads of is lovely.”
“Here‟s the lunch,” said Wilson. “You‟re very merry, aren‟t you?”
“Why not? I didn‟t co
me out here to be dull.”
“Well, it hasn‟t been dull,” Wilson said. He could see the boulders in the 
river and the high bank beyond with the trees and he remembered the 
morning.
“Oh, no,” she said. “It‟s been charming. And tomorrow. You don‟t 
know how I l
ook forward to tomorrow.”
“That‟s eland he‟s offering you,” Wilson said.
“They‟re the big cowy things that jump like hares, aren‟t they?”
“I suppose that describes them,” Wilson said.
“It‟s very good meat,” Macomber said.
“Yes.”
They‟re not dangerous
, are they?”
“Only if they fall on you,” Wilson told her.
“I‟m so glad.”
“Why not let up on the bitchery just a little, Margot,” Macomber said, 
cutting the eland steak and putting some mashed potato, gravy and 
carrot on the down=
-
turned fork that tined 
through the piece of meat.
“I suppose I could,” she said, “since you put it so prettily.”
“Tonight we‟ll have champagne for the lion,” Wilson said. “It‟s a bit too 
hot at noon.”
“Oh, the lion,” Margot said. “I‟d forgotten the lion!”
So, Robert Wilson t
hought to himself, she is giving him a ride, isn‟t 
she? Or do you suppose that‟s her idea of putting up a good show? How 
should a woman act when she discovers her husband is a bloody 
5
coward? She‟s damn cruel but they‟re all cruel. They govern, of course, 
a
nd to govern one has to be cruel sometimes. Still, I‟ve seen enough of 
their damn terrorism.
“Have some more eland,” he said to her politely.
That afternoon, late, Wilson and Macomber went out in the motor car 
with the native driver and the two gun
-
beare
rs. Mrs. Macomber stayed 
in the camp. It was too hot to go out, she said, and she was going with 
them in the early morning. As they drove off Wilson saw her standing 
under the big tree, looking pretty rather than beautiful in her faintly rosy 
khaki, her da
rk hair drawn back off her forehead and gathered in a knot 
low on her neck, her face as fresh, he thought, as though she were in 
England. She waved to them as the car went off through the swale of 
high grass and curved around through the trees into the sma
ll hills of 
orchard bush.
In the orchard bush they found a herd of impala, and leaving the car they 
stalked one old ram with long, wide
-
spread horns and Macomber killed 
it with a very creditable shot that knocked the buck down at a good two 
hundred yards 
and sent the herd off bounding wildly and leaping over 
one another‟s backs in long, leg
-
drawn
-
up leaps as unbelievable and as 
floating as those one makes sometimes in dreams.
“That was a good shot,” Wilson said. “They‟re a small target.”
“Is it a worth
-
w
hile head?” Macomber asked.
“It‟s excellent,” Wilson told him. “You shoot like that and you‟ll have 
no trouble.”
“Do you think we‟ll find buffalo tomorrow?”
“There‟s good chance of it. They feed out early in the morning and with 
luck we may catch them i
n the open.”
I‟d like to clear away that lion business,” Macomber said.
“It‟s not very pleasant to have your wife see you do something like 
that.”
I should think it would be even more unpleasant to do it, Wilson 
thought, wife or no wife, or the talk abo
ut it having done it. But he said, 
“I wouldn‟t think about that any more. Any one could be upset by his 
first lion. That‟s all over.”
But that night after dinner and a whisky and soda by the fire before 
going to bed, as Francis Macomber lay on his cot wit
h the mosquito bar 
over him and listened to the night noises it was not all over. It was 
neither all over nor was it beginning. It was there exactly as it happened 
with some parts of it indelibly emphasized and he was miserably 
ashamed at it. But more than
shame he felt cold, hollow fear in him. The 
fear was still there like a cold slimy hollow in all the emptiness where 
once his confidence had been and it made him feel sick. It was still there 
with him now.
It had started the night before when he had wake
ned and heard the lion 
roaring somewhere up along the river. It was a deep sound and at the 
and there were sort of coughing grunts that made him seem just outside 
the tent, and when Francis Macomber woke in the night to hear it he was 
afraid. He could hear
his wife breathing quietly, asleep. There was no 
one to tell he was afraid, nor to be afraid with him, and, lying alone, he 
did not know the Somali proverb that says a brave man is always 
frightened three times by a lion; when he first sees his track, whe
n he 
first hears him roar and when he first confronts him. Then while they 
were eating breakfast by lantern light out in the dining tent, before the 
sun was up, the lion roared again and Francis thought he was just at the 
edge of camp.
“Sounds like an old
-
timer,” Robert Wilson said, looking up from his 
kippers and coffee. “Listen to him cough.”
“Is he very close?”
“A mile or so up the stream.”
“Will we see him?”
“We‟ll have a look.”
6
“Does his roaring carry that far? It sounds as though he were right i
n 
camp.”
“Carries a hell of a long way,” said Robert Wilson. “It‟s strange the way 
it carries. Hope he‟s a shootable cat. The boys said there was a very big 
one about here.”
“If I get a shot, where should I hit him,” Macomber asked. “to stop 
him?”
“In t
he shoulders,” Wilson said. “In the neck if you can make it. Shoot 
for bone. Break him down.”
“I hope I can place it properly,” Macomber said.
“You shoot very well, “Wilson told him. “Take your time. Make sure of 
him. The first one in is the one that cou
nts.”
“What range will it be?”
“Can‟t tell. Lion has something to say about that. Won‟t shoot unless 
it‟s close enough so you can make sure.”
“At under a hundred yards?” Macomber asked.
Wilson looked at him quickly.
“Hundred‟s about right. Might have 
to take him a bit under. Shouldn‟t 
chance a shot at much over that. A hundred‟s a decent range. You can 
hit him wherever you want at that. Here comes the Memsahib.”
“Good morning,” she said. “Are we going after that lion?”
“As soon as you deal with your 
breakfast,” Wilson said.
“How are you feeling?”
“Marvelous,” she said. “I‟m very excited.”
“I‟ll just go and see that everything is ready,” Wilson went off. As he 
left the lion roared again.
“Noisy beggar,” Wilson said. “We‟ll put a stop to that.”
“What‟s the matter, Francis?” his wife asked him.
“Nothing,” Macomber said.
“Yes, there is,” she said. “What are you upset about?”
“Nothing,” he said.
“Tell me,” she looked at him. “Don‟t you feel well?”
“It‟s that damned roaring,” she said. “It‟s bee
n going on all night, you 
know.”
“Why didn‟t you wake me, she said. I‟d love to heard it.
“I‟ve got to kill the damned thing,” Macomber said, miserably.
“Well, that‟s what you‟re out here for, isn‟t it?”
“Yes. But I‟m nervous. Hearing the thing roar ge
ts on my nerves.”
“Well then, as Wilson said, kill him and stop his roaring.”
“Yes, darling,” said Francis Macomber. “It sounds easy, doesn‟t it?”
“You‟re not afraid, are you?”
“Of course not. But I‟m nervous from hearing him roar all night.”
“You‟ll 
kill him marvelously,” she said. “I know you will. I‟m awfully 
anxious to see it.”
“Finish your breakfast and we‟ll be starting.”
It‟s not light yet,” she said. “This is a ridiculous hour.”
7
Just then as the lion roared in a deep
-
chested
,
moaning, sudden
ly 
guttural, ascending vibration that seemed to shake the air and ended in a 
sigh and a heavy, deep
-
chested grunt.
“He sounds almost here,” Macomber‟s wife said.
“My God,” said Macomber. “I hate that damned noise.”
“It‟s very impressive.”
“Impressive. 
It‟s frightful.”
Robert Wilson came up then carrying his short, ugly, shockingly big
-
bored .505 Gibbs and grinning.
“Come on,” he said. “Your gun
-
bearer has your Springfield and the big 
gun. Everything‟s in the car. Have you solids?”
“Yes.”
“I‟m ready,
” Mrs. Macomber said.
“Must make him stop that racket,” Wilson said. “You got in front. The 
Memsahib can sit back here with me.”
They climbed into the motor car and, in the gray first day
-
light, moved 
off up the river through the trees. Macomber opened t
he breech of his 
rifle and saw 
he 
had metal
-
cased bullets, shut the bolt and put the rifle 
on safety. He saw his hand was trembling. He felt in his pocket for more 
cartridges and moved his fingers over the cartridges in the loops of his 
tunic front. He tur
ned back to where Wilson sat in the rear seat of the 
doorless, box
-
bodied motor car beside his wife, them both 
grinning
with
excitement
, and Wilson leaned forward and whispered, 
“See the birds dropping. Means the old boy has left his kill.”
On the far ban
k of the stream Macomber
could
see, above the trees, 
vultures circling and plummeting down.
“Chances are he‟ll come to drink along here,” Wilson whispered. Before 
he goes to lay up. Keep an eye out.”
They were driving slowly along the high bank of the st
ream which here 
cut deeply to its boulder
-
filled bed, and they wound in and out through 
big trees as they drove. Macomber was watching the opposite bank 
when he felt Wilson take hold of his arm. The car stopped.
“There he is,” he heard the whisper. “Ahead
and to the right. Get out 
and take him. He‟s marvelous lion.”
Macomber saw the lion now. He was standing almost broadside, his 
great head up and turned toward them. The early morning breeze that 
blew toward them was just stirring his dark mane, and the l
ion looked 
huge, silhouetted on the rise of bank in the gray morning light, his 
shoulders heavy, his barrel of a body bulking smoothly.
“How far is he?” asked Macomber, raising his rifle.
“About seventy
-
five. Get out and take him.”
“Why not shoot from w
here I am?”
“You don‟t shoot them from cars,” he heard Wilson saying in his car. 
“Get out. He‟s not going to stay there all day.”
Macomber stepped out of the curved opening at the side of the front 
seat, onto the step and down onto the ground. The lion s
till stood 
looking majestically and coolly toward this object that his eyes only 
showed in silhouette, bulking like some superrhino. There was no man 
smell carried toward his and he watched the object, moving his great 
head a little from side to side. Then
watching the object, not afraid, but 
hesitating before going down the bank to drink with such a thing 
opposite him, he saw a man figure detach itself from it and he turned his 
heavy head and swung away toward the cover for the trees as he heard a 
cracking
crash and felt the slam of a .30
-
06 220
-
grain solid bullet that 
bit his flank and ripped in sudden hot scalding nausea through his 
stomach. He trotted, heavy, big
-
footed, swinging wounded lull
-
bellied, 
the trees toward the tall grass and cover, and the cr
ash came again to go 
past him ripping the air apart. Then it crashed again and he felt the blow 
as it hit his lower ribs and ripped on through, blood sudden hot and 
frothy in his mouth, and he galloped toward the high grass where he 
8
could crouch and not be
seen and make them bring the crashing thing 
close enough so he could make a rush and get the man that held it.
Macomber had not thought how the lion felt as he got out of the car. He 
only knew his hands were shaking and as he walked away from the car 
it 
was almost impossible for him to make his legs move. They were stiff 
in the thighs, but he could feel the muscles fluttering. He raised the rifle, 
sighted on the junction of the lion‟s head and shoulders and pulled the 
trigger. Nothing happened though he p
ulled until he thought his finger 
would break. Then he knew he had the safety on and as he lowered the 
rifle to move the safety over he moved another frozen pace forward, and 
the lion seeing his silhouette now clear of the silhouette of the car, 
turned an 
started off at a trot, and, as Macomber fired, he heard a whunk 
that meant that the bullet was home;
but
the lion kept on going. 
Macomber shot again and every one saw the bullet throw a spout of dirt 
beyond the trotting lion. He shot again, remembering to 
lower his aim, 
and they all heard the bullet hit, and the lion went into a gallop and was 
in the tall grass before he had the bolt pushed forward.
Macomber stood there feeling sick at his stomach, his hands that held 
the springfield still cocked, shaking,
and his wife and Robert Wilson 
were standing by him. Beside him too were the two gun
-
bearers 
chattering in Wakamba.
“I hit him,” Macomber said. “I hit him twice.”
“You gut
-
shot him and you hit him somewhere forward,” Wilson said 
without enthusiasm. The 
gun
-
bearers looked very grave. They were 
silent now.
“You may have killed him” Wilson went on. “We‟ll have to wait a 
while before we go in to find out.”
“What do you mean?”
“Let him get sick before we follow him up.”
“Oh,” said Macomber.
“He‟s a hell 
of a fine lion,” Wilson said cheerfully. “He‟s gotten into a 
bad place though.”
“Why is it bad?”
“Can‟t see him until you‟re on him.”
“Oh,” said Macomber.
“Come on,” said Wilson. “The Memsahib can stay here in the car. We‟ll 
go to have a look at the bl
ood spoor.”
“Stay here, Margot,” Macomber said to his wife. His mouth was very 
dry and it was hard for him to talk.
“Why?” she asked.
“Wilson says to.”
“We‟re going to have a look,” Wilson said. “You stay her. You can see 
even better from here.”
“All 
right.”
Wilson spoke in Swahili to the driver. He nodded and said, “Yes, 
Bwana.”
Then they went down the steep bank and across the stream, climbing 
over and around the boulders and up the other bank, pulling up by some 
projecting roots, and along it unti
l they found where the lion had been 
trotting when Macomber first shot. There was dark blood on the short 
grass that the gun
-
bearers pointed out with grass stems, and that ran 
away behind the river bank trees.
“What do we do?” asked Macomber.
“Not much c
hoice,” said Wilson. “We can‟t bring the car over. Bank‟s 
too steep. We‟ll let him stiffen up a bit and then you and I‟ll go in and 
have a look for him.”
“Can‟t we set the grass on fire?” Macomber asked.
9
“Too green.”
“Can‟t we send beaters?”
Wilson loo
ked at him appraisingly. “Of course we can,” he said. “But 
it‟s just a touch murderous. You see we know the lion‟s wounded. You 
can drive an unwounded lion
—
he‟ll move on ahead of a noise
—
but a 
wounded lion‟s going to charge. You can‟t see him until you‟re 
right on 
him. He‟ll make himself perfectly flat in cover you wouldn‟t think 
would hide a hare. You can‟t very well send boys in there to that sort of 
a show. Somebody bound to get mauled.”
“What about the gun
-
bearers?”
“Oh, they‟ll go with us. It‟s the
ir shauri. You see, they signed on for it. 
They don‟t look too happy though, do they?”
“I don‟t want to go in there,” said Macomber. It was out before he knew 
he‟d said it.
“Neither do I,” said Wilson very cheerily. “Really no choice though.” 
Then, as an
afterthought, he glanced at Macomber and saw suddenly 
how he was trembling and the pitiful look on his face.
“You don‟t have to go in, of course,” he said. “that‟s what I‟m hired for, 
you know. That‟s why I‟m so expensive.”
“You mean you‟d go in by your
self? Why not leave him there?”
Robert Wilson, whose entire occupation had been with the lion ands the 
problem he presented, and who had not been thinking about Macomber 
except to note that he was rather windy, suddenly felt as though he had 
opened the wr
ong door in a hotel and seen something shameful.
“What do you mean?”
“Why not just leave him?”
“You mean pretend to ourselves he hasn‟t been hit?”
“No. Just drop it.
“It isn‟t done.”
“Why not?”
“For one thing, he‟s certain to be suffering. For anoth
er, some one else 
might run on to him.”
“I see.”
“But you don‟t have to have anything to do with it.”
“I‟d like to,” Macomber said. “I‟m just scared, you know.”
“I‟ll go ahead when we go in,” Wilson said, “with Kongoni tracking. 
You keep behind me and 
a little to one side. Chances are we‟ll hear him 
growl. If we see him we‟ll both shoot. Don‟t worry about anything. I‟ll 
keep you backed up. As a matter of fact, you know, perhaps you‟d better 
not go. It might be much better. Why don‟t you go over and join
the 
Memsahib while I just get it over with?”
“No, I want to go.”
“All right,” said Wilson. “But don‟t go in if you don‟t want to. This is 
my shauri now, you know.”
“I want to go,” said Macomber.
They sat under a tree and smoked.
“What to go back and 
speak to the Memsahib while we‟re waiting?” 
Wilson asked.
“No.”
“I‟ll just step back and tell her to be patient.”
“Good,” said Macomber. He sat there, sweating under his arms, his 
10
mouth dry, his stomach hollow feeling, wanting to find courage to tell 
Wi
lson to go on and finish off the lion without him. He could not know 
that Wilson was furious because he had not noticed the state he was in 
earlier and sent him back to his wife. While he sat there Wilson came 
up. “I have your big gun,” he said. “Take it. 
We‟ve given him time, I 
think. Come on.”
Macomber took the big gun and Wilson said”
“Keep behind me and about five yards to the right and do exactly as I 
tell you.” Then he spoke in Swahili to the two gun
-
bearers who looked 
the picture of gloom.
“Let‟s 
go,” he said.
“Could I have a drink of water?” Macomber asked. Wilson spoke to the 
older gun
-
bearer, who wore a canteen on his belt, and the man 
unbuckled it, unscrewed the top and handed it to Macomber, who took it 
noticing how heavy it seemed and how ha
iry and shoddy the felt 
covering was in his hand. He raised it to drink and looked ahead at the 
high grass with the flat
-
topped trees behind it. A breeze was blowing 
toward them and the grass rippled gently in the wind. He looked at the 
gun
-
bearer and he c
ould see the gun
-
bearer was suffering too with fear.
Thirty
-
five yards into the grass the big lion lay flattened out along the 
ground. His ears where back and his only movement was a slight 
twitching up and down of his long, black
-
tufted tail. He had turn
ed at 
bay as soon as he had reached this cover and he was sick with the 
wound through his full belly, and weakening with the wound through 
his lungs that brought a thin foamy red to his mouth each time he 
breathed. His flanks were wet and hot and flies wer
e on the little 
openings the solid bullets had made in his tawny hide, and his big 
yellow eyes, narrowed with hate, looked straight ahead, only blinking 
when the pain came as he breathed, and his claws dug in the soft baked 
earth. All of him, pain, sicknes
s, hatred and all of his remaining 
strength, was tightening into an absolute concentration for a rush. He 
could hear the men talking and he waited, gathering all of himself into 
this preparation for a charge as soon as the men would come into the 
grass. As
he heard their voices his tail stiffened to twitch up and down, 
and, as they came into the edge of the grass, he made a coughing grunt 
and charged.
Kongoni, the old gun
-
bearer, in the lead watching the blood spoor, 
Wilson watching the grass for any movem
ent, his big gun ready, the 
second gun
-
bearer looking ahead and listening, Macomber close to 
Wilson, his rifle cocked, they had just moved into the grass when 
Macomber hear the blood
-
choked coughing grunt, and saw the swishing 
rush in the grass. The next t
hing he knew he was running; running 
wildly, in panic in the open, running toward the stream.
He heard the ca
-
ra
-
wong! of Wilson‟s big rifle, and again in a second 
crashing carawong! and turning saw the lion, horrible
-
looking now, with 
half his head seemi
ng to be gone, crawling toward Wilson in the edge of 
the tall grass while the red
-
faced man worked the belt on the short ugly 
rifle and aimed carefully as another blasting carawong! came from the 
muzzle, and the crawling, heavy, yellow bulk of the lion sti
ffened and 
the huge, mutilated head slid forward and Macomber, standing by 
himself in the clearing where he had run, holding a loaded rifle, while 
two black men and a white man looked back at him in contempt, knew 
the lion was dead. He came toward Wilson, 
his tallness all seeming a 
naked reproach, and Wilson looked at him and said:
“What to take pictures?”
“No,” he said.
That was all any one had said until they reached the motor car. Then 
Wilson had said:
“Hell of a fine lion. Boys will skin him out. We
might as well stay here 
in the shade.”
Macomber‟s wife had not looked at him nor he at her and he had sat by 
her in the back seat with Wilson sitting in the front seat. Once he had 
reached over and taken his wife‟s hand without looking at her and she 
had
removed her hand from his. Looking across the stream to where the 
gun
-
bearers were skinning out the lion he could see that she had been 
able to see the whole thing. While they sat there his wife had reached 
forward and put her hand
on Wilson‟s shoulder. 
He turned and she had 
leaned forward over the low seat and kissed him on the mouth.
11
“Oh, I say,” said Wilson, going redder than his natural baked color.
“Mr. Robert Wilson,” she said. “The beautiful red
-
faced Mr. Robert 
Wilson.”
Then she sat down beside
Macomber again and looked away across the 
stream to where the lion lay, with uplifted, white
-
muscled, tendon
-
marked naked forearms, and white bloating belly, as the black men 
fleshed away the skin. Finally the gun
-
bearer brought the skin over, wet 
and hea
vy, and climbed in behind with it, rolling it up before they got in, 
and the motor car started. No one had said anything more until they 
were back in camp.
That was the story of the lion. Macomber did not know how the lion had 
felt before he started his r
ush, nor during it when the unbelievable smash 
of the .505 with a muzzle velocity of two tons had hit him in the mouth, 
nor what kept him coming after that, when the second ripping crash had 
smashed his hind quarters and he had come crawling on toward the 
crashing, blasting thing that had destroyed him. Wilson knew something 
about it and only expressed it by saying, “Damned fine lion,” but 
Macomber did not know how Wilson felt abut things either. He did not 
know how his wife felt except that she was through
with him.
His wife had been through with him before but it never lasted. He was 
very wealthy, and would be much wealthier, and he knew she would not 
leave him ever now. That was one of the few things that he really knew. 
He knew about that, about
motorc
ycles
—
that was earliest
—
about 
motor cars, about duck
-
shooting, about fishing, trout, salmon and big
-
sea, about sex in books, many books, too many books, about all court 
games, about dogs, not much about horses, about hanging on to his 
money, abut most of t
he other things his world dealt in, and about his 
wife not leaving him. His wife had been a great beauty and she was still 
a great beauty in Africa, but she was not a great enough beauty any 
more at home to be able to leave him and better herself and she k
new it 
and he knew it. She had missed the chance to leave him and he knew it. 
If he had been better with women she would probably have started to 
worry about him getting another new, beautiful wife; but she knew too 
much about him to worry about him either
. Also he had always had a 
great tolerance which seemed the nicest thing about him if it were not 
the most sinister.
All in all they were known as a comparatively happily married couple, 
one of those whose disruption is often rumored but never occurs, and
as 
the society columnist put it, they were adding more than a spice of 
adventure to their much envied and ever enduring romance by a Safari 
in what was known as Darkest Africa until the Martin Johnsons lighted 
it on so many silver screens where they were 
pursuing Old Simba the 
lion, the buffalo, Tembo the elephant and as well collecting specimens 
for the Museum of Natural History. This same columnist had reported 
them on the verge as least three times in the past and they had been. But 
they always made it 
up. They had a sound basis of union. Margot was 
too beautiful for Macomber to divorce her and Macomber had too much 
money for Margot ever to leave him.
It was now about three o‟clock in the morning and Francis macomber, 
who had been asleep a little while 
after he had stopped thinking about 
the lion, wakened and then slept again, woke suddenly, frightened in a 
dream of the bloody
-
headed lion standing over him, and listening while 
his heart pounded, he realized that his wife was not in the other cot in 
the t
ent. He lay awake with the knowledge of two hours.
At the end of that time his wife came into the tent, lifted her mosquito 
bar and crawled cozily into bed.
“Where have you been?” Macomber asked in the darkness.
“Hello,” she said. “Are you awake?”
“Whe
re have you been?”
“I just went out to get a breath of air.”
“You did, like hell.”
“What do you want me to say, darling?”
“Where have you been?”
“Out to get a breath of air.”
12
“That‟s a new name for it. You are a bitch.”
“Well, you‟re coward.”
“All 
right,” he said. “What of it?”
“Nothing as far as I‟m concerned. But please let‟s not talk, darling, 
because I‟m very sleepy.”
“You think that I‟ll take anything.”
“I know you will, sweet.”
“Well, I won‟t.”
“Please, darling, let‟s not talk. I‟m so ver
y sleepy.”
“There wasn‟t going to be any of that. You promised there wouldn‟t 
be.”
“Well, there is now,” she said sweetly.
“You said if we made this trip that there would be none of that. You 
promised.”
“Yes, darling. That‟s the way I meant it to be. B
ut the trip was spoiled 
yesterday. We don‟t have to talk about it, do we?”
“You don‟t wait long when you have an advantage, do you?”
“Please let‟s not talk. I”m so sleepy, darling.”
“I‟m going to talk.”
“Don‟t mind me then, because I‟m going to sleep.”
And she did.
At breakfast they were all three at the table before daylight and Francis 
Macomber found that, of all the many men that he had hated, he hated 
Robert Wilson the most.
“Sleep well?” Wilson asked in his throaty voice, filling a pipe.
“Did yo
u?”
“Topping,” the white hunter told him.
You bastard, thought Macomber, you insolent bastard.
So she woke him when she came in, Wilson thought, looking at them 
both with his flat, cold eyes. Well, why doesn‟t he keep his wife where 
she belongs?” What d
oes he think I am, a bloody plaster saint? Let him 
keep her where she belongs. It‟s his own fault.
“Do you think we‟ll find buffalo?” Margot asked, pushing away a dish 
of apricots.”
“Chance of it,” Wilson said and smiled at her. “Why don‟t you stay in 
ca
mp?”
“Not for anything,” she told him.
“Why not order her to stay in camp?” Wilson said to Macomber.
“Your order her,” said Macomber coldly.
“Let‟s not have any ordering, nor,” turning to Macomber, “any silliness, 
Francis,” Margot said quite pleasantly
.
“Are you ready to start?” Macomber asked.
“Any time,” Wilson told him. “Do you want the Memsahib to go?”
“Does it make any difference whether I do or not?”
The hell with it, thought Robert Wilson. The utter complete hell with it. 
So this is what it‟s
going to be like. Well, this is what it‟s going to be 
like, then.
“Makes no difference,” he said.
15
bul
l slide forward onto his nose.
“Get that other,” Wilson said. “Now you‟re shooting!”
But the other bull was moving steadily at the same gallop and he 
missed, throwing a spout of dirt, and Wilson missed and the dust rose in 
a cloud and Wilson shouted, “Co
me on.” He‟s too far!” and grabbed his 
arm and they were in the car again, Macomber and Wilson hanging on 
the sides and rocketing swayingly over the uneven ground, drawing up 
on the steady, plunging, heavy
-
necked, straight
-
moving gallop of the 
bull.
They 
were behind him and Macomber was filling his rifle, dropping 
shells onto the ground, jamming it, clearing the jam, then they were 
almost up with the bull when Wilson yelled “Stop,” and the car skidded 
so that it almost swung over and Macomber fell forward 
as he aimed 
into the galloping, rounded black back, aimed and shot again, then 
again, then again, and the bullets, all of them hitting, had no effect on 
the buffalo that he could see. Then Wilson shot, the roar deafening him, 
and he could see the bull stag
ger. Macomber shot again, aiming 
carefully, and down he came, onto his knees.
“All right,” Wilson said. “Nice work. That‟s the three.”
Macomber felt a drunken elation.
“How many times did you shoot?” he asked.
“Just three,” Wilson said. “You killed the
first bull. The biggest one. I 
helped you finish the other two. Afraid they might have got into cover. 
You had them killed. I was just mopping up a little. You shot damn 
well.
“Let‟s go to the car,” said Macomber. “I want a drink.”
“Got to finish off th
at buff first,” Wilson told him. The buffalo was on 
his knees and he jerked his head furiously and bellowed in pig
-
eyed, 
roaring rage as they came toward him.
“Watch he doesn‟t get up,” Wilson said. Then, “Get a little broadside 
and take him in the neck j
ust behind the ear.”
Macomber aimed carefully at the center of the huge, jerking, rage
-
driven neck and shot. At the shot the head dropped forward.
“That does it,” said Wilson. “Got the spine. They‟re a hell of a fine
-
looking thing, aren‟t they?”
“Let‟s 
get the drink,” said Macomber. In his life he had never felt so 
good.
“In the car Macomber‟s wife sat very white
-
faced. “You were 
marvelous, darling,” she said to Macomber. “What a ride.”
“Was it rough?” Wilson asked.
“It was frightful. I‟ve never been 
more frightened in my life.”
“Let‟s all have a drink,” Macomber said.
“By all means,” said Wilson. “Give it to the Memsahib.” She drank the 
neat whisky from the flask and
shuddered a little when she swallowed. 
She handed the flask to Macomber who handed
it to Wilson.
“It was frightfully exciting,” she said. “It‟s given me a dreadful 
headache. I didn‟t know you were allowed to shoot them from cars 
though.”
“No one shot from cars,” said Wilson coldly.
“I mean chase them from cars.”
“Wouldn‟t ordinarily
,” Wilson said. “Seemed sporting enough to me 
though while we were doing it. Taking more chance driving that way 
across the plain full of holes and one thing and another than hunting on 
foot. Buffalo could have charged us each time we shot if he liked.
Ga
ve 
him every chance. Wouldn‟t mention it to anyone though. It‟s illegal if 
that‟s what you mean.”
“It seemed very unfair to me,” Margot said, “chasing those big helpless 
16
things in a motor car.”
“Did it?” said Wilson.
“What would happen if they heard abo
ut it in Nairobi?”
“I‟d lose my license for one thing. Other unpleasantnesses,” Wilson 
said, taking a drink from the flask. “I‟d be out of business.”
“Really?”
“Well,” said Macomber, and he smiled for the first time all day.
“Now she has something 
on you.”
“You have such a pretty way of putting things, Francis,” Margot 
Macomber said. Wilson looked at them both. If a four
-
letter man 
marries a five
-
letter woman, he was thinking, what number of letters 
would their children be? What he said was, “We lo
st a gun
-
bearer. Did 
you notice it?”
“My God, no,” Macomber said.
“Here he comes,” Wilson said. “He‟s all right. He must have fallen off 
when we left the first bull.”
Approaching them was the middle
-
aged gun
-
bearer, limping along in his 
knitted cap, kha
ki tunic, shorts and rubber sandals, gloomy
-
faced and 
disgusted looking. As he came up he called out to Wilson in Swahili and 
they all saw the change in the white hunter‟s face.
“What does he say?” asked Margot.
“He says the first bull got up and went in
to the bush,” Wilson said with 
no expression in his voice.
“Oh,” said Macomber blankly.
“Then it‟s going to be just like the lion,” said Margot, full of 
anticipation.
“It‟s not going to be a dammed bit like the lion,” Wilson told her. “Did 
you want anot
her drink Macomber?”
“Thanks, yes, Macomber said. He expected the feeling he had had about 
the lion to come back but it did not. For the first time in his life he rally 
felt wholly without fear. Instead of fear he had a feeling of definite 
elation.
“We‟l
l go and have a look at the second bull,” Wilson said. “I‟ll tell the 
driver to put the car in the shade.”
“What are you going to do?” asked Margaret Macomber.
“Take a look at the buff,” Wilson said.
“I‟ll come.”
“Come along.”
The three of them walked
over to where the second buffalo bulked 
blackly in the open, head forward on the grass, the massive horns swung 
wide.
“He‟s a very good head,” Wilson said. “That‟s close to a fifty
-
inch 
spread.”
Macomber was looking at him with delight.
“He‟s hateful l
ooking,” said Margot. “Can„t we go into the shade?”
“Of course,” Wilson said. “Look,” he said to Macomber, and pointed. 
“See that patch of bush?”
“Yes.”
“That‟s where the first bull went in. The gun
-
bearer said when he fell 
off the bull was down. He was
watching us helling along and the other 
two buff galloping. When he looked up there was the bull up and 
looking at him. Gun
-
bearer ran like hell and the bull went off slowly 
into the bush.”
17
“Can we go in after him now?” asked Macomber eagerly.
Wilson lo
oked at him appraisingly. Damned if this isn‟t a strange one, 
he thought. Yesterday he‟s scared sick and today he‟s a ruddy fire eater.
“No, we‟ll give him a while.”
“Let‟s please go into the shade,” Margot said. Her face was white and 
she looked ill.
T
hey made their way to the car where it stood under a single, wide
-
spreading tree and all climbed in.
“Chances are he‟s dead in there,” Wilson remarked. “After a little we‟ll 
have a look.”
Macomber felt a wild unreasonable happiness that he had never know
n 
before.
“By God, that was a chase,”
he said. “I‟ve never felt any such feeling. 
Wasn‟t it marvelous, Margot?”
“I hated it.”
“Why?”
“I hated it,” she said bitterly. “I loathed it.”
“You know I don‟t think I‟d ever be afraid of anything again,” 
Macom
ber said to Wilson. “Something happened in me after we first 
saw the buff and started after him. Like a dam bursting. It was pure 
excitement.”
“Cleans out your liver,” said Wilson.” Damn funny things happen to 
people.”
Macomber‟s face was shining. “You k
now something did happen to 
me,” he said. “I feel absolutely different.”
His wife said nothing and eyed him strangely. She was sitting far back 
in the seat and Macomber was sitting forward talking to Wilson who 
turned sideways talking over the back of the
front seat.
“You know, I‟d like to try another lion,” Macomber said. “I‟m really not 
afraid of them now. After all, what can they do to you?”
“That‟s it,” said Wilson. “Worst one can do is kill you. How does it go? 
Shakespeare. Damned good. See if I can
remember. Oh, damned good. 
Used to quote it to myself at one time. Let‟s see. „By my troth, I care 
not; a man can die but once; we owe God a death and let it go which 
way it will he that dies this year is quit for the next.‟ Damned fine, 
oh?”
He was v
ery embarrassed, having brought out this thing he had lived by, 
but he had seen men come of age before and it always moved him. It 
was not a matter of their twenty
-
first birthday.
It had taken a strange chance of hunting, a sudden precipitation into 
actio
n without opportunity for worrying beforehand, to bring this about 
with Macomber, but regardless of how it had happened it had most 
certainly happened. Look at the beggar now, Wilson thought. It‟s that 
some of them stay little boys so long, Wilson thought.
Sometimes all 
their lives. Their figures stay boyish when they‟re fifty. The great 
American boy
-
men. Damned strange people. But he like this Macomber 
now. Damned strange fellow. Probably meant the end of cuckoldry too. 
Well, that would be a damned good th
ing. Damned good thing. Beggar 
had probably been afraid all his life. Don‟t know what started it. But 
over now. Hadn‟t had time to be afraid with the buff. That and being 
angry too. Motor car too. Motor cars made it familiar. Be a damn fire 
eater now. He‟d
seen it in the war work the same way. More of a change 
than any loss of virginity. Fear gone like an operation. Something else 
grew in its place. Main thing a man had. Made him into a man. Women 
knew it too. No bloody fear.
From the far corner of the sea
t Margaret Macomber looked at the two of 
them. There was no change in Wilson. She saw Wilson as she had seen 
him the day before when she had first realized what his great talent was. 
But she saw the change in Francis Macomber now.
18
“Do you have that feelin
g of happiness about what‟s going to happen?” 
Macomber asked, still exploring his new wealth.
“You‟re not supposed to mention it,” Wilson said, looking in the other‟s 
face. “Much more fashionable to say you‟re scared. Mind you, you‟ll be 
scared too, plent
y of times.”
But you have a feeling of happiness about action to come?”
“Yes,” said Wilson. “There‟s that. Doesn‟t do to talk too much about all 
this. Talk the whole thing away. No pleasure in anything if you mouth it 
up too much.
“You‟re both talking r
ot,” said Margot. “Just because you‟ve chased 
some helpless animals in a motor car you talk like heroes.
“Sorry,” said Wilson. “I have been gassing too much.” She‟s worried 
about it already, he thought.
“If you don‟t know what we‟re talking about why not
keep out of it?” 
Macomber asked his wife.
“You‟ve gotten awfully brave, awfully suddenly,” his wife said 
contemptuously, but her contempt was not secure. She was very afraid 
of something.
Macomber laughed, a very natural hearty laugh. “You know I have,”
he 
said. “I really have.”
“Isn‟t it sort of late?” Margot said bitterly. Because she had done the 
best she could for many years back and the way they were together now 
was no one person‟s fault.
“Not for me,” said Macomber.
Margot said nothing but sat 
back in the corner of the seat.
“Do you think we‟ve given him time enough?” Macomber asked Wilson 
cheerfully.
“We might have a look,” Wilson said. “Have you any solids left?”
“The gun
-
bearer has some.”
Wilson called in Swahili and the older gun
-
bearer,
who was skinning 
out one of the heads, straightened up, pulled a box of solids out of his 
pocket end brought them over to Macomber, who filled his magazine 
and put the remaining shells in his pocket.
“You might as well shoot the Springfield,” Wilson said
. “You‟re used to 
it. We‟ll leave the Mannlicher in the car with the Memsahib.
Your gun
-
bearer can carry your heavy gun. I‟ve this damned cannon. Now let me 
tell you about them.” He had saved this until the last because he did not 
want to worry Macomber. 
“When a buff comes he comes with his head 
high and thrust straight out. The boss of the horns covers any sort of a 
brain shot. The only shot is straight into the nose. The only other shot is 
into his chest or, if you‟re to one side, into the neck or the sh
oulders. 
After they‟ve been hit once they take a hell of a lot of killing. Don‟t try 
anything fancy. Take the easiest shot there is. They‟ve finished skinning 
out that head now. Should we get started.?”
He called to the gun
-
bearers, who came up wiping the
ir hands, and the 
older one got into the back.
“I‟ll only take Kongoni,” Wilson said. “The other can watch to keep the 
birds away.”
As the car moved slowly across the open space toward the island of 
brushy trees that ran in a tongue of foliage along a dr
y water course that 
cut the open swale, Macomber felt his heart pounding and his mouth 
was dry again, but it was excitement, not fear.
“Here‟s where he went in,” Wilson said. Then to the gun
-
bearer in 
Swahili, “Take the blood spoor.”
The car was parallel
to the patch of bush. Macomber, Wilson and the 
gun
-
bearer got down. Macomber, looking back, saw his wife, with the 
rifle by her side, looking at him. He waved to her and she did not wave 
back.
19
The brush was very thick ahead and the ground was dry. The mi
ddle
-
aged gun
-
bearer was sweating heavily and Wilson had his hat down 
over his eyes and his red neck showed just ahead of Macomber. 
Suddenly the gun
-
bearer said something in Swahili to Wilson and ran 
forward.
“He‟s dead in there,” Wilson said. “Good work,
” and he turned to grip. 
Macomber‟s hand and as they shook hands, grinning at each other, the 
gun
-
bearer shouted wildly and they saw him coming out of the bush 
sideways, fast as a crab, and the bull coming, nose out, mouth tight 
closed, blood dripping, mis
sive head straight out, coming in a charge, 
his little pig eyes bloodshot as he looked at them. Wilson who was 
ahead was kneeling shooting, and Macomber, as he fired, unhearing his 
shot in the roaring of Wilson‟s gun, saw fragments like slate burst from 
th
e huge boss of the horns, and the head jerked, he shot again at the 
wide nostrils and saw the horns jolt again and fragment fly, and he did 
not see Wilson now and, aiming carefully, shot again with the buffalo‟s 
huge bulk almost on him and his rifle almost
level with the on
-
coming 
head, nose out, and he could see the little wicked eyes and the head 
started to lower and he felt a sudden white
-
hot, blinding flash explode 
inside his head and that was all he ever felt.
Wilson had ducked to one side to get in a
shoulder shot. Macomber had 
stood solid and shot for the nose, shooting a touch high each time and 
hitting the heavy horns, splintering and chipping them like hitting a slate 
roof, and Mrs. Macomber, in the car, had shot at the buffalo with the 6.5 
Mannli
cher as it seemed about to gore Macomber and had hit her 
husband about two inches up and a little to one side of the base of his 
skull.
Francis Macomber lay now, face down, not two yards from where the 
buffalo lay on his side and his wife knelt over him w
ith Wilson beside 
her.
“I wouldn‟t turn him over,” Wilson said.
The woman was crying hysterically.
“I‟d get back in the car,” Wilson said. “Where‟s the rifle?”
She shook her head, her face contorted. The gun
-
bearer picked up the 
rifle.
Leave it as it 
is,” said Wilson. Then, “Go get Abdulla so that he may 
witness the manner of the accident.”
He knelt down, took a handkerchief from his pocket, and spread it over 
Francis Macomber‟s crew
-
cropped head where it lay. The blood sank 
into the dry, loose earth.
Wilson stood up and saw the buffalo on his side, his legs out, his thinly
-
haired belly crawling with ticks. “Hell of a good bull,” his brain 
registered automatically. “A good fifty inches, or better. Better.” He 
called to the driver and told him to sprea
d a blanket over the body and 
stay by it. Then he walked over to the motor car where the woman sat 
crying in the corner.
“That was a pretty thing to do,” he said in a toneless voice. “He would 
have left you too.”
“Stop it,” she said.
“Of course it‟s an 
accident,” he said. “I know that.”
“Stop it,” she said.
“Don‟t worry,” he said. “There will be a certain amount of 
unpleasantness but I will have some photographs taken that will be very 
useful at the inquest. There‟s the testimony of the gun
-
bearer and 
the 
driver too. You‟re perfectly all right.”
“Stop it,” she said.
“There‟s a hell of a lot to be done,” he said. “And I‟ll have to send a 
truck off to the lake to wireless for a plane to take the three of us into 
Nairobi. Why didn‟t you poison him? That‟
s what they do in England.”
“Stop it. Stop it. Stop it,” the woman cried.
Wilson looked at her with his flat blue eyes.

“I‟m through now,” he said. “I was a little angry. I‟d begun to like your 
husband.”
“Oh, please stop it,” she said. “Please, please 
stop it.”
“That‟s better,” Wilson said. “Please is much better. Now I‟ll stop.”
